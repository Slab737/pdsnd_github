## Bikeshare Project
By Stephen Laba.

### Project Description
The Bikeshare project was build as part of the _Introduction to Python_ subject of the
**Programming for Data Science with Python** course.

The project looks at data related to bike share systems for three cities in the United States:
_Chicago_, _New York City_, and _Washington_.

The user can only see ones city's worth of data at a time, so to begin with,
the user will be asked to type in one of the cities **Chicago**, **New York City** or **Washington**.

They will be asked to if they would like to filter the data by month, day, both or none.

Various statistics will then display of the data based on their choices, the use will have to
press **Enter** to move from each section.

After the statistics have run, raw data can be displayed for 5 bike share users at a time if the user chooses,
if not they can either reset or terminate the program.
